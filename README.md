PHP Library: SIE
================

Parser and generator for SIE files (http://sie.se/).

PHP port of https://github.com/barsoom/sie

Current implementation requires PHP 5.6.5 or greater.

## Installation

Via composer:

    composer require neam/php-sie

## Generating a SIE file

To generate a SIE document you first need to define a class that implements \sie\document\IDataSource or extends abstract class \sie\document\DataSource.

```php
$mySieFileDataSource = new MySieFileDataSource($this);
$sieFileDocument = $mySieFileDataSource->generateSieDocument();
$sieFileContents = $sieFileDocument->render();
file_put_contents('sie_file.se', $sieFileContents);
```

Check the files in tests/unit/*Test.php for more examples.

## Parsing a SIE file

You can parse sie data as follows:

```php
$file_contents = file_get_contents('sie_file.se');
$parser = new \sie\Parser();
$sie_file = $parser->parseSieFileContents($file_contents);

// The company name
echo $sie_file->entries_with_label("fnamn")[0]->attributes->foretagsnamn;

// The first account number
echo $sie_file->entries_with_label("konto")[0]->attributes->kontonr;
```

The parseSieFileContents method expects file contents in CP437 encoding (the official encoding of the SIE file format). If you want to parse UTF8 strings, use the "parse" method:  

```php
$sie_file = $parser->parse($utf8_string);
```

By default the parser will raise an error if it encounters unknown entry types. Use the `lenient` option to avoid this:

```php
$parser = new \sie\Parser(["lenient" => true]);
```

Check the files in tests/integration/*Test.php for more examples.
